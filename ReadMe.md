### Talk on &ldquo;Open access publishing: A researcher&rsquo;s perspective&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I will give at the
[Scholarly Publishing Symposium](https://www.library.wisc.edu/news/scholarly-publishing-symposium-2014/)
at the Pyle Center on 30 Oct 2014.

I gave a slightly longer version at a symposium on open
access publishing,
&ldquo;[Open Access, Open Data @ UW](https://researchdata.wisc.edu/open-access-open-data/),&rdquo;
organized by the
[UW&ndash;Madison libraries](https://library.wisc.edu) and
[Research Data Services Group](https://researchdata.wisc.edu).
The symposium was held 8&ndash;10:30am on Thursday, 24 Oct 2013, at
the
[DeLuca Forum](https://discovery.wisc.edu/home/town-center/apply-to-reserve-town-center-spaces/hf-deluca-forum/)
at the
[Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery](https://discovery.wisc.edu/discovery).

See the [2013-10 branch](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_OpenAccess/tree/2013-10).

The pdf is [here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/openaccess.pdf).

And [here's a version with notes on what I said](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/openaccess_withnotes.pdf).

A video (recorded later) is available [on youtube](https://youtu.be/gVu0IdG3keM).
