  \$18 for a 2-page paper?

  I understand that the publishing industry has a long history of
  screwy pricing, but you'd have to be either \textbf{desperate} or
  \textbf{stupid} to pay these prices.

  And for that 1999 Genetic Epidemiology article, published by Wiley,
  you have to register in order to find out that it's \$35 for 24-access.

Most of the cost behind a research paper are paid by grants or

There are real costs associated with journals, but in the end they are
all paid from the same sources (grants and institutional funds).

Do we really want to give away the product of our research and then
buy it back repeatedly, at great profit to the publishers?

\note{The Open Access discussion often gets tied up with discussion
  about peer review, predatory publishing, and journal impact
  factors.

  But to me, whether we want stringent peer review before publication
  or instead to leave the evaluation entirely to post-publication
  review, is a completely separate issue.

  On the other hand, the current culture is to evaluate researchers
  based on the perceived quality of the journals in which they've
  published. This makes it difficult to change to open access.

  If everyone's still going to send their best work to Science,
  Nature, \& Cell, then that work will continue to be locked up behind
  pay walls.

\note{The usual way in which publishing costs are paid are through a
  combination of subscriptions (both institutional and individual) and
  direct charges to the author.

  In the new open access model, the page charges are increased in
  order to eliminate the subscription fees. One might have a fee for
  all submitted manuscripts and not just those accepted for
  publication.

  I've not seen much discussion of other alternatives, but I would
  prefer to see endowments established, particularly for
  well-established society journals.  Alternatively, journals might be
  funded directly through grants.

\note{The page charges, and the continued reliance on impact factors,
  lead to difficult choices, particularly for young investigators.

  Should I pay for open access, or should I let the subscribers pay
  and use the savings to do more experiments?

  Should I support young open access journals, or should I continue to
  go ofter Science, Nature, \& Cell?

  The best scientists may confidently maintain their pure publication
  record.

  But more mediocre scientists, who may be just scraping by,
  probably don't feel they have that luxury.  A Nature paper can
  ``make you.''

\item {\color<2>{vhilight} Reform copyright law}
\ei

\note{We need to send our best work to open access journals.

We need to find ways to support our junior colleagues, so that they
may do so as well.

We need to evaluate people based on their work and not by the name of
the journal in which it appeared. We all may say, ``Science and
Nature are often crap and there are lots of fantastic papers that
appear elsewhere.'' But somehow when we see Nature or Cell on
someone's CV, we still have an immediate, positive reaction.

I would like to see endowed journals, open forever.

The quickest way to make the product of federally funded research
would be to reform copyright law. If the product of our research were
forced open by law, the publishing industry would figure out how to
pay for it in short order.

But given the state of politics in the US, I'm not too optimistic
about that.
